<h3>Summary of my findings:</h3>

<p>Altitude online is a company operated on twelve different branches using 4 different information systems. Jon, the CIO of the company, decided that they should begin the process of merging the companies together because it will be beneficial for the centralized system and increase the overall productivity.<a href = "#jump">(Read this)</a></p> <br>


<p> In order to do the following, Jon must use an ERP system that will be able to retrieve and sort of data across the system. This will also help Altitude Online be more of an  economical and efficient company.<a href="#jump2">(Read this)</a></p><br>

<p><b>1. Why is it a problem for Altitude Online to use different information systems in its branch locations?</b> - Using different information system becomes unmanageable and difficult to keep track for the central office location as there are twelve different locations scattered across the country  to keep track off. Ultimately sharing and using the information for the company’s benefit becomes harder as there are four information system shared amongst different vendors. </p><br>

<p><b>2.What information should Jon collect from the branch offices to plan the new centralized information system?</b> - Jon first needs to collect data such as number of people, supply and capital within the locations. He should also collect data like what type of systems were being used, the inputs and outputs, the different software and hardware being worked with. With the data Jon can help the different vendors reach the same level so they all are to merge as one system.</p><br>

<p><b>3.With Jon's education and experience, he could design and implement a new information system Altitude Online himself. What would be the benefits and drawbacks of doing the job himself compared to contracting with an information systems contractor?</b></p><br>

<p><b>4.While Jon is visiting the branch offices, how might he prepare them for the inevitable upheaval caused by the upcoming overhaul to the information system?</b></p><br>
<ol>
<li>Jon can start by analyzing the problems the current systems is facing and ask for opinions and input of others</li>
<li>Next he can introduce ideas on how a new centralized system can be beneficial</li> 
<li>Then Jon can design and present the new system and show the problem are solved</li> 
<li>After being implemented he should consistently check up on it for a smooth and efficient merge to the new design</li>

<p><b>1.What are the advantages of Altitude Online adopting a new ERP system compared to simply connecting existing corporate systems?</b> - With ERP system, the company will be better informed which leads them to make better decision and forecast, cost efficient for both the company and the customers, time it takes to retrieves data is significantly lower and increase and productivity.</p><br>

<p><b>2.Why isn’t an out-of-the-box ERP system enough for Altitude Online? What additional needs does the company have? Is this the case for businesses in other industries also?</b> - Out-of-the-box ERP system comes with built in tools and features, because they tend to target business as a whole the system elements are vague and non-customizable which wouldn’t work for the company since it wants to target specific users. Altitude online needs their own developer that can meet the their specific needs so it can pick and choose what they need. Other businesses have the same case because they would want to make a system based on their own needs.</p><br>

<p><b>3.Why do you think Jon is taking weeks to directly communicate with stakeholders about the new system?</b> - Because stakeholders have stakes that can directly affect them if there’s a change, Jon should be able to inform them and take their opinion and be able to convince them with the benefits and productivity the new system will bring to the table.</p><br>

<p><b>Why do you think Jon and the system administrators decided to outsource the software for this system to an ERP company rather than developing it from scratch themselves?</b> - Outsourcing will allow them to build off from their strong points of the already existing system, they are familiar with it so they know what is best for them and what areas must be improved. Outsourcing will also save Jon on money and time.</p><br>
